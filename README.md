# PIPN
Public IP Python Notifier

This Python script identifies the host's public IP address using ipify.org's api.
If the script finds the public IP has changed, then it will attempt to send an email notification to the email (SMTP) provided.
This script may be useful to admin's needing to know their public IP, that are not paying their ISP for a static IP.
